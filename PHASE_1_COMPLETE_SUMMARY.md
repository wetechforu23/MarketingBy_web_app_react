## 🐛 Known Limitations (Phase 1)

1. **Posting**: Only Facebook posting is implemented
   - LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, Google Business: API integration ready, just need to add posting methods (similar to Facebook)

2. **Media Upload**: Currently using URLs
   - Phase 2 can add direct file upload with Cloudinary/S3

3. **Scheduling**: Cron job needs to be set up
   - Backend code ready, just need to configure Heroku Scheduler

4. **Templates**: Table exists but UI not built yet
   - Can be added in Phase 2
