# 🔧 Fix for 500 Error - Restart Backend

## ✅ Changes Made

I've added better error handling to the `/facebook/full-data/:clientId` endpoint to:
1. Catch errors when fetching posts with inline insights
2. Catch errors when fetching overview data
3. Continue with empty data instead of crashing
4. Log detailed error information

---

## 🚀 **Steps to Fix:**

### **1. Stop Backend Server**
In your **backend terminal** (the one running `npm run dev`):
- Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server

### **2. Restart Backend Server**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

Or if you're already in the backend directory:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **3. Test Again**
1. Refresh your browser (http://localhost:5174)
2. Go to Social Media tab
3. Scroll to "📊 Facebook Full Data & Analytics"
4. The admin boxes should now appear
5. Enter your Page ID and Access Token
6. Click "Save & Test Token"

## 📋 **What to Look For in Backend Terminal:**

After restarting and testing, you should see logs like:
```
📊 === API: Fetching FULL Facebook data for client 1 ===
   Requesting 100 posts with inline insights

📝 [INLINE INSIGHTS] Fetching posts with insights for page 744651835408507...
   Limit: 100 posts
🔗 [INLINE INSIGHTS] Initial URL: ...

✅ Fetched X posts with inline insights
✅ Overview data: Found (or Not found)
✅ Fetched X posts with full insights
```

---

## ❓ **If You Still Get 500 Error:**

Please share the **backend terminal output** so I can see the exact error message. Look for lines with:
- `❌ Get full Facebook data error:`
- `⚠️ Error fetching posts with inline insights:`
- `⚠️ Error fetching overview:`

These will tell us exactly what's failing.

---

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior After Fix:**

1. **Token saves successfully** ✅
2. **Backend logs show detailed fetch process**
3. **Either:**
   - Data loads successfully, OR
   - Specific error message about what failed (permissions, token, etc.)
4. **No more generic 500 errors**

---

## 💡 **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue: "Permission denied"**
**Solution:** Your token needs `read_insights` permission
- Go to Graph API Explorer
- Click "Get User Access Token"
- Add permissions:
  - `pages_show_list`
  - `read_insights`
  - `pages_read_engagement`
- Generate new token

### **Issue: "Invalid OAuth access token"**
**Solution:** Token expired or incorrect
- Get a new token from Graph API Explorer
- Make sure to select your page

### **Issue: "No posts found"**
**Solution:** This is OK if you have no posts
- The system will show zeros
- Try creating a post on your Facebook page first

---

## ✅ **Action Required:**

**RIGHT NOW:**
1. **Stop backend** (Ctrl + C in backend terminal)
2. **Restart backend** (`npm run dev`)
3. **Test in browser** (refresh and try again)
4. **Share backend logs** if still having issues

The improved error handling will now tell us exactly what's wrong instead of just crashing with 500 error.
