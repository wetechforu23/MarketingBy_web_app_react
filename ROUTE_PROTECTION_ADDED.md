# ✅ Route Protection Added for Client Users

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** 🔒 **PROTECTED**

---

## 🎯 What Was Done

Added **route protection** so client users (client_admin and client_user) cannot access restricted pages, even if they try to type the URL directly.

---

## 🔒 Protected Routes

These pages are now **blocked for client users**:

### 1. **Leads Pages**
- ❌ `/app/leads` - Leads list
- ❌ `/app/leads/:id` - Lead details
- ✅ Only accessible by: Super Admin & WeTechForU team

### 2. **Client Management**
- ❌ `/app/client-management` - Client management dashboard
- ❌ `/app/settings/clients` - Clients settings
- ✅ Only accessible by: Super Admin & WeTechForU team

---

## 🛡️ How It Works

### Before (Not Secure)
```
Client User types: /app/leads
❌ Page loads - User can see data!
```

### After (Secure)
```
Client User types: /app/leads
✅ Access denied message appears
🚫 Cannot access the page
🔄 Redirect to Dashboard button shown
```

---

## 👤 What Client Users See

If a client user tries to access a protected page, they'll see:

```
🚫
Access Denied

You don't have permission to access this page.

[Go to Dashboard]
```

---

## ✅ What Client Users CAN Access

Client users can only access:
- ✅ `/app/dashboard` - Their client dashboard
- ✅ `/app/profile` - Their user profile
- ✅ Public pages (login, homepage, etc.)

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Created Component
**`frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`**
- Checks user role before rendering page
- Shows "Access Denied" if unauthorized
- Shows loading spinner while checking

### Protected Routes in Router
**`frontend/src/router/index.tsx`**
```typescript
// Example protected route
{ 
  path: "leads", 
  element: <ProtectedRoute requireWeTechForU={true}>
    <Leads />
  </ProtectedRoute> 
}
```

### Parameters
- **`requireSuperAdmin`** - Only super admin can access
- **`requireWeTechForU`** - Super admin or WeTechForU team
- **`allowedRoles`** - Specific roles allowed (array)

4. ✅ Cannot access the page

### Test 3: Dashboard Still Works

2. Go to: `http://localhost:5173/app/dashboard`
3. ✅ Dashboard should load normally

### Test 4: Super Admin Can Access
1. Log in as: `info@wetechforu.com` (Super Admin)
2. Go to: `http://localhost:5173/app/leads`

## 📝 Future Protection

If you want to protect more routes, just wrap them:

  path: "some-page", 
  element: <ProtectedRoute requireWeTechForU={true}>
    <SomePage />
  </ProtectedRoute> 
}
```
