# 🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FIXED - Database Table Name Mismatch**

## **Date:** October 24, 2025  
## **Heroku Version:** v319 ✅ DEPLOYED

---

## 🚨 **The Problem**

**Error You Saw:**
```
❌ Errors: 50
Reason: relation "knowledge_base" does not exist
```

**Root Cause:**
- Database migration creates table: `widget_knowledge_base`
- Backend code was looking for: `knowledge_base`
- **Mismatch!** Table name was wrong in 8 places

---

## ✅ **The Fix**

### **Changed in `backend/src/routes/chatWidget.ts`:**

| Endpoint | SQL Query | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| `GET /widgets/:id/knowledge` | SELECT from knowledge_base | ✅ Fixed |
| `POST /widgets/:id/knowledge` | INSERT into knowledge_base | ✅ Fixed |
| `PUT /widgets/:id/knowledge/:knowledgeId` | UPDATE knowledge_base | ✅ Fixed |
| `DELETE /widgets/:id/knowledge/:knowledgeId` | DELETE from knowledge_base | ✅ Fixed |
| `POST /widgets/:id/knowledge/bulk` | SELECT (duplicate check) | ✅ Fixed |
| `POST /widgets/:id/knowledge/bulk` | INSERT (bulk upload) | ✅ Fixed |
| `GET /widgets/:id/knowledge/categories` | SELECT categories | ✅ Fixed |
| `findSimilarQuestions()` | SELECT for matching | ✅ Already correct |

**All 8 SQL queries now use:** `widget_knowledge_base` ✅

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS widget_knowledge_base (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    widget_id INTEGER REFERENCES widget_configs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    category VARCHAR(100),
    question TEXT NOT NULL,
    answer TEXT NOT NULL,
    keywords TEXT[],
    priority INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    context JSONB,
    times_used INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    helpful_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    not_helpful_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **Table Name Correct:**
- ✅ `widget_knowledge_base` (used everywhere now)
- ❌ `knowledge_base` (was causing errors)

## 📞 **Next Steps**

1. ⏰ **Wait 3-5 minutes** for Netlify deployment
2. 🔄 **Hard refresh** Admin UI (`Cmd + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + Shift + R`)
3. 📤 **Upload** `wetechforu-knowledge-base-corrected.json`
4. ✅ **Verify** all 50 entries inserted
5. 🧪 **Test** bot with sample questions
6. 🎯 **Deploy** widget to your website!

---

## 🚨 **If You Still Get Errors**

### **"relation widget_knowledge_base does not exist"**
This means the database migration hasn't been run yet. You need to:

1. **Check if migration file exists:**
   ```
   backend/database/add_ai_chat_widget.sql
   ```

2. **Run migration on Heroku:**
   ```bash
   heroku pg:psql -a marketingby-wetechforu
   ```
   
3. **Paste the contents of:**
   ```
   add_ai_chat_widget.sql
   ```

4. **Confirm tables created:**
   ```sql
   \dt widget_*
   ```

### **"Invalid JSON format"**
- Make sure you're using `wetechforu-knowledge-base-corrected.json`
- Not the old file with `user_question` and `bot_answer`

### **"Widget not found"**
- Verify you created the widget first
- Check the widget ID in the URL
