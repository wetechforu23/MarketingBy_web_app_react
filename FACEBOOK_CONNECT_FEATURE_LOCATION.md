## ‚ùå What's MISSING (Why you don't see it on the Integration Settings page)

### The Issue:
I created the **entire Facebook Connect feature** as a **separate page** at:
```
http://localhost:5173/app/facebook-connect/:clientId
```

But I **never added a button or link** in the Integration Settings to navigate to this new page!

### What Needs to Be Added:
In the **Integration Settings** tab, we need to add a new section like:

```
üìò Facebook Connection (New System)
[üîó Go to Advanced Facebook Connect] button
```

This button should navigate to: `/app/facebook-connect/${clientId}`

---

## üéØ How to Access It Manually (For Testing):

1. Open your browser to: `http://localhost:5173/app/client-management`
2. Select "WeTechForU" client (client ID = likely 1 or 2)
3. Manually navigate to: `http://localhost:5173/app/facebook-connect/1`
   - Replace `1` with the actual client ID you want to test

You should see:
- Method 1: Connect with Link (OAuth flow)
- Method 2: Manual Token Input

---

## üîß Next Step: Add Access Button

Would you like me to:
1. Add a "üîó Advanced Facebook Connect" button in the Integration Settings tab?
2. Or keep this as a completely separate feature you access manually via URL?

The idea was to keep it **isolated** so we can test it thoroughly before integrating it into the main Social Media tab.
