# 🔒 AI Chat Widget Enhancements - Version 348

## 📋 Overview

This release adds **6 major enhancements** to the AI chat widget system, focusing on **HIPAA compliance**, **client-specific AI**, **proper agent handoff**, and **email notifications**.

---

## ✅ **1. SENSITIVE DATA DETECTION & HIPAA COMPLIANCE**

### **What It Does:**
Automatically detects and BLOCKS sensitive/HIPAA-protected information **BEFORE** it reaches the AI.

### **Patterns Detected:**
| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **SSN** | 123-45-6789, 123 45 6789 |
| **Credit Cards** | 4111-1111-1111-1111 |
| **Medical Records** | MRN #12345, Patient ID: ABC123 |
| **Insurance Info** | Policy #123456, Member #789012 |
| **Date of Birth** | DOB: 01/15/1985, Birthday: 1/15/85 |
| **Diagnosis Codes** | A12.3, Z23.4 (ICD codes) |
| **Medical Terms** | "diagnosed with", "prescription for", "symptoms" |
| **Bank Accounts** | Account #12345678, Routing #987654321 |

### **How It Works:**
```
User sends: "My SSN is 123-45-6789"
         ↓
🚨 SENSITIVE DATA DETECTED: ssn
         ↓
✋ BLOCKED - Not sent to AI
         ↓
Bot response: "⚠️ Security Notice: For your privacy and security, 
we cannot handle sensitive information like SSN through this chat.

🔒 Please:
• Call us directly at [PRACTICE_PHONE]
• Or request to speak with an agent

We take your privacy seriously and comply with all HIPAA regulations."
```

### **Logging:**
- All blocked attempts logged in `llm_request_logs` table
- Status: `'blocked'`
- Includes detected types for audit trail

---

## ✅ **2. CLIENT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE BASE (AI Isolation)**

### **What It Does:**
Ensures each client's AI only uses **their own knowledge base** - no cross-client data sharing.

### **How It Works:**
```sql
-- Each widget filters by widget_id (which belongs to ONE client)
SELECT question, answer, category 
FROM widget_knowledge_base 
WHERE widget_id = $1  -- Client-specific
ORDER BY times_used DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### **Security:**
- ✅ Widget belongs to specific client
- ✅ Knowledge base filtered by widget_id
- ✅ LLM context built from client's data ONLY
- ✅ Zero cross-client data leakage

---

## ✅ **3. PROPER AI-TO-AGENT HANDOFF FLOW**

### **Problem Before:**
- Once agent replied, AI would STILL respond to user messages
- No way for agent to give conversation back to AI
- Confusing for users and agents

### **Solution:**

#### **Scenario 1: Agent Takes Over**
```
User: "I need help"
Bot: "How can I assist?"
User: "This is urgent"
         ↓
[Requests Agent]
         ↓
Agent replies: "Hi, I'm here to help!"
         ↓
✅ agent_handoff = true
         ↓
User: "Thank you"
         ↓
❌ AI DOES NOT RESPOND (agent is handling)
         ↓
Agent continues conversation...
```

#### **Scenario 2: Agent Hands Back to AI**
```
Agent: "I've answered your question. AI can help with more!"
         ↓
[Agent clicks "Hand Back to AI"]
         ↓
POST /conversations/:id/handback-to-ai
         ↓
✅ agent_handoff = false
✅ agent_can_handback_to_ai = true
         ↓
User: "What are your hours?"
         ↓
✅ AI RESPONDS AGAIN
```

### **New Endpoints:**
```typescript
// Agent hands conversation back to AI
POST /api/chat-widget/conversations/:conversationId/handback-to-ai
Body: {
  userId: 123,
  username: "Agent Smith"
}

Response: {
  success: true,
  message: "Conversation handed back to AI"
}
```

---

## ✅ **4. END CONVERSATION & SEND SUMMARY EMAIL**

### **What It Does:**
Agent can close conversation and automatically send professional summary email to the CLIENT (visitor).

### **Endpoint:**
```typescript
POST /api/chat-widget/conversations/:conversationId/end
Body: {
  userId: 123,
  username: "Agent Smith",
  summaryNote: "Scheduled appointment for next week"  // Optional
}
```

### **Email Sent to Client:**
```
Subject: Conversation Summary - ABC Dental

```

### **Check Engagement Emails Sent:**
