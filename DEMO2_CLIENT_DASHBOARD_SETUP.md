## 🔧 For Developers

### **Files Created:**
```
backend/src/routes/clientDashboard.ts          (NEW - API endpoint)
backend/database/create_demo2_user.sql         (NEW - User creation)
frontend/src/pages/ClientDashboardNew.tsx      (NEW - Dashboard UI)
CLIENT_DASHBOARD_REAL_DATA.md                  (Documentation)
```

frontend/src/router/index.tsx                  (Updated routing)
```

### **How It Works:**
1. User logs in → Session created with `client_id`
2. Frontend calls `/api/client-dashboard/overview`
3. Backend queries database using `client_id` from session
4. Returns aggregated real data
5. Frontend displays beautiful UI with real numbers

## 🆘 Need Help?

### **Common Questions:**

**Q: Client sees all zeros for metrics**  
**A:** Check if there's actual data in the database for that client_id. Run:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM leads WHERE client_id = 199;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM seo_audits WHERE client_id = 199;
```

**Q: "Client ID not found in session" error**  
**A:** User needs to log in again. Session expired or cookie issue.

**Q: Can I customize the dashboard?**  
**A:** Yes! Edit `frontend/src/pages/ClientDashboardNew.tsx`. It's React/TypeScript.

**Q: How do I add more metrics?**  
**A:** 
1. Add SQL query in `backend/src/routes/clientDashboard.ts`
2. Add display card in `frontend/src/pages/ClientDashboardNew.tsx`
