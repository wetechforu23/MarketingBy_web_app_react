# 🔒 Client-Specific Widget & Knowledge Base Isolation

## 📋 Overview

Your chat widget system now has **complete client isolation**! Each client has their own widget with their own private knowledge base. The bot ONLY answers using that specific client's knowledge.

## 🎯 How Client Isolation Works

### The Flow:

    Answer: "9-5"                    Answer: "24/7"
    (From Client A knowledge)        (From Client B knowledge)
```

## 🆕 What Changed

### 1. **Widget Assignment to Clients**

**Before:** Widgets weren't clearly assigned to specific clients

**Now:** Each widget MUST be assigned to ONE client

```
Widget Table:
- id: 1
- widget_name: "wetechforu test"
- client_id: 67  ← THIS IS THE KEY!
- widget_key: "wtfw_4525d305fed7021509584adfdd2bcf71"
```

### 2. **Client Selector When Creating Widgets**

**For Super Admins:**
- When you create a NEW widget, you'll see a big blue box
- Select which client this widget is for
- That client gets their own private knowledge base

**For Regular Users:**
- Widget is automatically assigned to your client
- No selector shown (you can only create for your own company)

### 3. **Knowledge Base Isolation**

**Each client manages their own knowledge:**

```sql
-- Client A adds knowledge to their widget (widget_id: 1)
INSERT INTO knowledge_base (widget_id, question, answer)
VALUES (1, 'What are your hours?', 'Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM');

-- Client B adds knowledge to their widget (widget_id: 2)
INSERT INTO knowledge_base (widget_id, question, answer)
VALUES (2, 'What are your hours?', 'We are open 24/7');
```

**Result:**
- Client A's bot says: "Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM"
- Client B's bot says: "We are open 24/7"
- **NO MIXING!** Each client only sees their own knowledge

## 🛠️ How to Use

### For Super Admins (WeTechForU):

#### Step 1: Create Widget for a Client

1. **Go to:** Chat Widgets → Create Widget
2. **You'll see a blue box at the top:**
   ```
   🏢 Select Client (Required) *
   [ Dropdown list of all clients ]
   ```
3. **Select the client** (e.g., "ABC Dental Clinic")
4. **Fill in widget settings** (colors, bot name, etc.)
5. **Save** → Widget is now assigned to that client!

#### Step 2: Add Knowledge for That Client

1. **Go to:** Chat Widgets → Click "Knowledge" button
2. **You'll see a banner:**
   ```
   🔒 Private Knowledge Base: This knowledge is ONLY for Client 67.
   When customers chat on this client's website, the bot will ONLY use knowledge from this list.
   ```
3. **Add Q&A pairs** specific to this client:
   - "What services do you offer?" → "We provide dental implants, cleanings, and orthodontics"
   - "Where are you located?" → "123 Main St, Allen, TX"
   - "How do I book?" → "Call (469) 888-0705 or use our booking link"

#### Step 3: Give Client the Plugin

1. **Click "WP Plugin" button** → Downloads `wetechforu-chat-widget.php`
2. **Send to client** with installation instructions
3. **Client installs** on their WordPress site
4. **Bot goes live** with ONLY that client's knowledge!

---

### For Clients (Your Customers):

## 🔐 Security & Isolation Guarantees

### ✅ What's Protected:

1. **Knowledge Base:**
   - Client A cannot see Client B's knowledge
   - Each widget has unique `widget_key`
   - Database queries filter by `widget_id`

2. **Conversations:**
   - Stored per widget
   - Client A cannot access Client B's chats
   - Complete conversation history isolation

3. **Bot Responses:**
   - Bot only searches knowledge for that specific `widget_id`
   - No cross-client data leakage
   - Responses are 100% unique to each client

## 📊 Database Structure

### How It's Organized:

```sql
-- WIDGET TABLE
widget_configs
├── id (1)
├── client_id (67) ← Links to client
├── widget_key (wtfw_abc123) ← Unique identifier
└── widget_name

-- KNOWLEDGE TABLE
knowledge_base
├── id
├── widget_id (1) ← Links to widget
├── question ("What are your hours?")
├── answer ("9 AM - 5 PM")
└── category

-- CONVERSATIONS TABLE
widget_conversations
├── id
├── widget_id (1) ← Links to widget
└── visitor_info

-- MESSAGES TABLE
widget_messages
├── id
├── conversation_id
├── message_text
└── is_bot
```

### Query Flow (When Customer Chats):

```sql
-- 1. Customer visits website with widget_key: wtfw_abc123
-- 2. Customer asks: "What are your hours?"
-- 3. Bot searches knowledge:

SELECT answer 
FROM knowledge_base
WHERE widget_id = (
    SELECT id FROM widget_configs 
    WHERE widget_key = 'wtfw_abc123'
)
AND question LIKE '%hours%';

-- 4. Returns: "9 AM - 5 PM" (ONLY for this client!)
```

## 🧪 Testing Client Isolation

### Test Scenario:

1. **Create Widget for Client A (ID: 67)**
   - Add knowledge: "Hours: 9-5"

2. **Create Widget for Client B (ID: 105)**
   - Add knowledge: "Hours: 24/7"

3. **Install Widget A** on Client A's website

4. **Install Widget B** on Client B's website

5. **Test:**
   - Go to Client A's site → Ask "What are your hours?" → Get "9-5"
   - Go to Client B's site → Ask "What are your hours?" → Get "24/7"

✅ **Result:** Each client's bot answers with their own knowledge!
