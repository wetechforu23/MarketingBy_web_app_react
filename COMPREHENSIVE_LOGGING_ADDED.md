## 🔍 How to Use These Logs

### **1. Check If API Is Being Called:**
Look for:
```
🔄 [REFRESH API] Starting Facebook data refresh for client XXX
```

### **2. Check If Credentials Are Found:**
Look for:
```
✅ Credentials found:
   📄 Page ID: ...
   🔑 Token: ...
```

If you see `❌ No Facebook credentials found`, you need to run the SQL update!

### **3. Check If Data Is Being Stored:**
Look for:
```
✅ Page-level metrics stored (1 row affected)
✅ All X posts stored (Y inserted, Z updated)
✅ Transaction committed
```

### **4. Check For Errors:**
Look for:
```
❌ [DB ERROR]
❌ [REFRESH API ERROR]
❌ DATABASE TRANSACTION ERROR!
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Restart your backend** (I'll do this now)
2. **Update Client 105 token in database** (run the SQL)
3. **Test by switching clients** and watch the logs
4. **Click "Refresh All Data"** and see every step

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Keep the backend terminal window visible while testing
- Logs are timestamped so you can see exactly when things happen
- Token previews show first 20 and last 10 characters (secure!)
- Duration tracking helps identify slow operations
- Insert/Update counts show if data is being refreshed or added

**Your logs are now production-ready for debugging!** 🎉
