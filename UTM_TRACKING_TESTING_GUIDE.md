# 🧪 UTM Tracking Testing Guide - Text Posts

**Status**: ✅ **INTEGRATED - READY FOR TESTING**  
**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Feature**: UTM tracking now integrated into Facebook text posting

---

## ✅ What Was Changed

### 1. **Import Added** ✅
```typescript
import { UTMTrackingService } from './utmTrackingService';
```

### 2. **createTextPost() Method Updated** ✅
- Gets client name from database
- Processes message with UTM tracking
- Posts tracked content to Facebook
- Stores UTM data in database (graceful if migration not run)
- Falls back to original message if UTM fails

---

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST LOCALLY

### **Prerequisites:**
- ✅ Backend running locally
- ✅ Facebook page connected in your database
- ✅ Database migration (optional - can test without it)

---

### **Test 1: Basic Text Post with URL** ⭐

**Step 1:** Start your local backend:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\raman\OneDrive\Desktop\wetechfor u\main app\MarketingBy_web_app_react\backend"
npm start
```

**Step 2:** Create a test post through your app:
1. Login to your local app (http://localhost:5173)
2. Go to Content Library or Social Media Posting
3. Create a Facebook text post with a URL:
   ```
   Check out our new services! https://wetechforu.com/services
   ```
4. Post it to Facebook

**Expected Result:**
```
📘 Creating Facebook text post for page 123456789...
🔗 Processing content with UTM tracking...
🔗 Found 1 URL(s) in post content
📊 UTM Tracking Applied:
   Campaign: your_client_name_fb_text_1761682716026
   Original URLs: 1
   Tracked URLs: 1
✅ UTM tracking applied to 1 URL(s)
   Campaign: your_client_name_fb_text_1761682716026
✅ Facebook text post created: 123456789_987654321
📊 UTM tracking data stored in database  (or warning if migration not run)
```

**Check Facebook:**
1. Go to your Facebook page
2. Look at the post
3. The URL should have UTM parameters:
   ```
   https://wetechforu.com/services?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=your_client_name_fb_text_1761682716026&utm_content=text
   ```

---

### **Test 2: Text Post WITHOUT URL** ✅

**Post Content:**
```
Just a regular announcement with no links!
```

**Expected Result:**
```
📘 Creating Facebook text post for page 123456789...
🔗 Processing content with UTM tracking...
ℹ️  No URLs found in post content - skipping UTM tracking
✅ Facebook text post created: 123456789_987654321
```

✅ **Post works normally, no UTM tracking needed**

---

### **Test 3: Multiple URLs in One Post** ✅

**Post Content:**
```
Visit our website https://wetechforu.com or book online https://wetechforu.com/booking
```

**Expected Result:**
```
🔗 Found 2 URL(s) in post content
📊 UTM Tracking Applied:
   Campaign: your_client_name_fb_text_1761682716028
   Original URLs: 2
   Tracked URLs: 2
✅ UTM tracking applied to 2 URL(s)
```

**Check Facebook:**
Both URLs should have the SAME campaign ID with UTM parameters.

---

### **Test 4: URL with Existing Parameters** ✅

**Post Content:**
```
Book your appointment: https://wetechforu.com/booking?service=checkup&location=miami
```

**Expected Result:**
```
🔗 Found 1 URL(s) in post content
✅ UTM tracking applied to 1 URL(s)
```

**Check Facebook:**
URL should preserve existing parameters AND add UTM:
```
https://wetechforu.com/booking?service=checkup&location=miami&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=...
```

---

### **Test 5: Graceful Fallback (If Something Breaks)** ✅

If UTM tracking fails for any reason:
- ✅ Post still gets created on Facebook
- ✅ Original message is posted (without UTM tracking)
- ⚠️ Warning logged in console

**This ensures**: Facebook posting NEVER breaks due to UTM tracking!

---

## 📊 How to Verify Database Storage

### **If You Ran the Migration:**

**Check the database:**
```sql
SELECT 
  post_id,
  message,
  utm_campaign,
  utm_source,
  utm_medium,
  original_urls,
  tracked_urls,
  created_time
FROM facebook_posts
WHERE utm_campaign IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_time DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

You should see:
- `utm_campaign`: Unique campaign ID
- `utm_source`: 'facebook'
- `utm_medium`: 'social'
- `original_urls`: Array of original URLs
- `tracked_urls`: Array of URLs with UTM params

---

### **If You DIDN'T Run the Migration:**

You'll see this in the console:
```
⚠️  Could not store UTM data in database: column "utm_campaign" does not exist
   (This is OK if you haven't run the UTM migration yet)
```

**This is FINE!** The post still works, UTM tracking still works on Facebook, just not stored in DB.

---

## 🔍 How to Test in Google Analytics

### **Step 1:** Create and post a message with URL

### **Step 2:** Click the URL in the Facebook post

### **Step 3:** Check Google Analytics:
1. Go to Google Analytics for that website
2. Navigate to: **Acquisition** → **Traffic Acquisition** or **All Traffic** → **Source/Medium**
3. Look for: **facebook / social**
4. Click on it to see campaigns
5. You should see your campaign name: `your_client_name_fb_text_1761682716026`

### **What You'll See:**
- **Source**: facebook
- **Medium**: social
- **Campaign**: your_client_name_fb_text_1761682716026
- **Sessions**: 1+ (depending on clicks)
- **Users**: 1+
- **Conversions**: (if any goals are set up)

## 📞 Need Help?

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Cannot find module utmTrackingService"**
   - Solution: Restart backend server

2. **"Column utm_campaign does not exist"**
   - Solution: This is expected if you haven't run migration
   - It will still post to Facebook with UTM tracking
   - Just won't store in DB

3. **"Facebook posting failed"**
   - Check if Facebook credentials are still valid
   - Check backend console for detailed error
