## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Make sure servers are running
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open browser
```
URL: http://localhost:5173/login
```

### Step 3: Log in with Demo2 credentials
```
📧 Email: demo2@abc.com
🔑 Password: Demo2@2025
```

### Step 4: View the Dashboard
You should see:
- ✅ Welcome message with client name "Demo-2"
- ✅ Key metrics cards (Leads, SEO, Traffic, Facebook)
- ✅ Company profile information
- ✅ Connected services status
- ✅ Recent reports section

---

## 📊 What Data You'll See

### Metrics Displayed
- **Total Leads** - Count from `leads` table for client 199
- **SEO Score** - Latest audit from `seo_audits` table
- **Website Visitors** - Analytics from `analytics_data` table
- **Facebook Followers** - Metrics from `facebook_page_metrics` table

### If Data is Empty
- Metrics will show **0** or **N/A**
- This is normal if Demo-2 client has no data yet
- The dashboard still works - it's showing real (empty) data!

---

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check Backend Logs
Look for these in your terminal:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 [BACKEND] Client Dashboard Overview Request
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 [BACKEND] Session Data: {
  sessionID: '...',
  userId: 102,
  role: 'client_admin',
  clientId: 199,
  username: 'Demo2 Client Admin'
}
✅ [BACKEND] Client ID found: 199
✅ [BACKEND] Dashboard overview compiled successfully!
```

### Check Frontend Console
Open browser console (F12) and look for:
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📊 [FRONTEND] Fetching REAL dashboard data...
✅ [FRONTEND] Dashboard data received successfully!
📦 [FRONTEND] Response data: { client: {...}, metrics: {...} }
```

### If You See Errors
Run the verification script:
```bash
cd backend
node check_demo2_user.js
```

Should show:
```
✅ User "demo2@abc.com" is assigned to: Demo-2 (ID: 199)
✅ User is assigned to the correct client!
```
