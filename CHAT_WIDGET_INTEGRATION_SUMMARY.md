---

## 📊 DATABASE RELATIONSHIPS

### Client → Widget (One-to-Many)
```sql
CLIENTS (id) → WIDGET_CONFIGS (client_id)
```
- **Each client can own multiple chat widgets**
- Widgets are tied to a specific client for access control
- Client deletion cascades to delete all their widgets

**Example:**
- Client "Align Primary Care" (id: 67)
  - Widget 1: "Main Website Chat" 
  - Widget 2: "Blog Page Chat"
  - Widget 3: "Appointment Chat"

### Widget → Conversations (One-to-Many)
```sql
WIDGET_CONFIGS (id) → WIDGET_CONVERSATIONS (widget_id)
```
- **Each widget receives multiple conversations**
- All visitor interactions tracked per widget
- Widget deletion cascades to delete conversations

**Example:**
- Widget "Main Website Chat" (id: 1)
  - Conversation #1 with John Doe
  - Conversation #2 with Jane Smith  
  - Conversation #3 with Anonymous Visitor

### Widget → Knowledge Base (One-to-Many)
```sql
WIDGET_CONFIGS (id) → WIDGET_KNOWLEDGE_BASE (widget_id)
```
- **Each widget has its own knowledge base**
- AI responses are widget-specific
- Knowledge entries are reusable across conversations

**Example:**
- Widget "Healthcare Chat" (id: 1)
  - "What are your hours?" → "9 AM - 5 PM Monday-Friday"
  - "How do I book?" → "Click the appointment button"
  - "What services?" → "Primary care, urgent care, etc."

### Conversation → Leads (One-to-One)
```sql
WIDGET_CONVERSATIONS (lead_id) → LEADS (id)
```
- **Captured conversations create leads**
- Lead source automatically set to "chat_widget"
- Maintains full conversation history with lead record

**Example:**
- Conversation #42 with john@example.com
  - Lead captured: "John Doe" (id: 129)
  - Source: "chat_widget"
  - All messages preserved for context

### Conversation → Messages (One-to-Many)
```sql
WIDGET_CONVERSATIONS (id) → WIDGET_MESSAGES (conversation_id)
```
- **Each conversation contains multiple messages**
- Messages alternate between user and bot
- AI confidence scores tracked per message

**Example:**
- Conversation #42
  - Message #1: "Hi! What are your hours?" (user)
  - Message #2: "We're open 9-5 Mon-Fri!" (bot, confidence: 0.95)
  - Message #3: "Can I book an appointment?" (user)
  - Message #4: "Absolutely! What date works?" (bot, confidence: 0.88)

### Knowledge Base → Messages (One-to-Many)
```sql
WIDGET_KNOWLEDGE_BASE (id) → WIDGET_MESSAGES (knowledge_base_id)
```
- **Knowledge entries power bot responses**
- Usage tracking for knowledge optimization
- Helpful/not helpful feedback loop

### User → Widget (One-to-Many - Creator)
```sql
USERS (id) → WIDGET_CONFIGS (created_by)
```
- **Track who created each widget**
- Audit trail for widget management
- User permissions control widget access

### Widget → Analytics (One-to-Many)
```sql
WIDGET_CONFIGS (id) → WIDGET_ANALYTICS (widget_id)
```
- **Daily analytics aggregation per widget**
- Historical performance tracking
- Trend analysis and reporting

### Widget → Appointments (One-to-Many)
```sql
WIDGET_CONFIGS (id) → WIDGET_APPOINTMENTS (widget_id)
WIDGET_CONVERSATIONS (id) → WIDGET_APPOINTMENTS (conversation_id)
```
- **Appointments booked through chat**
- Full context of booking conversation
- Calendar integration ready
