## 📋 **NEXT STEPS TO GO LIVE:**

### **STEP 1: Run Database Migration**

You need to apply the new schema to your database:

```bash
# For local database:
cd /Users/viraltarpara/Desktop/github_viral/MarketingBy_web_app_react
psql -U your_username -d your_database_name -f backend/database/subscription_and_agreements_schema.sql

# For Heroku database:
heroku pg:psql --app marketingby-wetechforu < backend/database/subscription_and_agreements_schema.sql
```

**Expected Output:**
```
ALTER TABLE
CREATE TABLE
CREATE INDEX
INSERT 0 3
...
```

### **STEP 2: Create Stripe Products**

   UPDATE subscription_plans 
   SET stripe_product_id = 'prod_yyy', stripe_price_id = 'price_yyy'
   WHERE name = 'Professional Healthcare Marketing';
