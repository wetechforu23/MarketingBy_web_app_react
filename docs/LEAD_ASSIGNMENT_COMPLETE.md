---

## ✅ **WHAT WE BUILT**

### 1. **Backend & Database** ✅
- **Database Schema**:
  - `leads.assigned_to` - User ID of assigned team member
  - `leads.assigned_at` - Timestamp of assignment
  - `leads.assigned_by` - User ID who made the assignment  
  - `leads.assignment_notes` - Notes about assignment
  - `lead_assignment_history` table - Complete audit trail

- **6 API Endpoints**:
  ```
  POST   /api/lead-assignment/assign          - Assign single lead
  POST   /api/lead-assignment/unassign        - Remove assignment
  POST   /api/lead-assignment/bulk-assign     - Bulk assign multiple leads
  GET    /api/lead-assignment/my-leads        - Get my assigned leads
  GET    /api/lead-assignment/history/:leadId - View assignment history
  GET    /api/lead-assignment/team-workload   - View team distribution
  ```

### 2. **Frontend Logic** ✅
- **State Management**:
  - `teamMembers` - Filtered to WeTechForU team only (excludes client users)
  - `currentUser` - Current logged-in user
  - `assignedToFilter` - Filter state ('all', 'unassigned', 'assigned', user ID)
  - `showMyLeadsOnly` - Toggle for "My Leads" view

- **Smart Functions**:
  - `handleAssignLead()` - Assign/reassign single lead
  - `handleBulkAssign()` - Bulk assignment with team member list
  - `fetchTeamMembers()` - Loads only WeTechForU users (no clients)
  - Automatic filtering logic for non-super_admin users

### 3. **User Interface** ✅
- **"My Leads" Toggle Button** (Green)
  - Quick access to your assigned leads
  - Toggles between "My Leads" and "All Leads"
  - Only visible for logged-in users

- **"Assign Selected" Button** (Yellow)
  - Appears when leads are selected via checkbox
  - Shows team member list with IDs and roles
  - Bulk assign multiple leads at once

- **"Assigned To" Filter Dropdown**
  - Filter by: All Leads, Unassigned, Assigned, or specific team member
  - Positioned next to "My Leads" button
  - Consistent styling with other controls

- **"Assigned To" Table Column**
  - New column header after "Status"
  - Sticky header for scrolling
  - Icon indicator (👤)

- **Assignment Dropdown in Each Lead Row**
  - Visual color coding:
    - 🟢 **Green** = Assigned (background: `#d4edda`)
    - 🔴 **Red** = Unassigned (background: `#fff5f5`)
  - Dropdown shows:
    - "❌ Unassigned" option
    - List of WeTechForU team members only
    - Current assignment marked with ✅
  - Assignment metadata:
    - Shows "By {admin} • Oct 11, 2024"
    - Only visible when lead is assigned
  - Hover effects and smooth transitions
  - Click dropdown → Select team member → Lead assigned instantly

---

## 🔒 **SECURITY & PERMISSIONS**

✅ **WeTechForU Team Only**:
- Only users without `client_id` can be assigned leads
- Client users are automatically filtered out
- Super admin can assign to anyone on the team

✅ **Role-Based Access**:
- **Super Admin** (you):
  - See ALL leads by default
  - Can toggle "My Leads" to see only your assigned leads
  - Can assign ANY lead to ANY team member
  - Can filter by any team member
  
- **Team Members** (when you add them):
  - Automatically see ONLY their assigned leads (backend enforced)
  - Cannot see unassigned leads
  - Cannot see other team members' leads
  - Same UI as super admin (no visual difference)
  - Full access to manage their assigned leads

✅ **Audit Trail**:
- Every assignment tracked in `lead_assignment_history`
- Shows: who assigned, who to, when, why, notes
- Complete history preserved for compliance
