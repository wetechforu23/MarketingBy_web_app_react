## ❓ **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Q: Can I change the featured image after publishing?**

**A:** Yes! Edit the blog, change the image, and save. WordPress will update automatically on next edit/re-publish.

---

### **Q: What if I don't have a featured image?**

**A:** That's okay! The blog will still publish. However, images significantly improve engagement on LinkedIn and in search results. Consider using a free stock photo or waiting for AI image generation feature.

---

### **Q: Can I add multiple featured images?**

**A:** WordPress only supports one featured image. You can add more images within the blog content itself (in the HTML).

---

### **Q: Do categories and tags affect SEO?**

**A:** Yes! They create additional indexed pages on your WordPress site and help search engines understand your content structure. Just don't overdo it—3-5 categories site-wide and 5-10 tags per blog is ideal.

---

### **Q: Can I edit the LinkedIn post after sharing?**

**A:** Yes, but only on LinkedIn itself. The share button just opens LinkedIn with pre-filled data. You can edit everything before posting.

---

### **Q: Why is the AI image generation not working yet?**

**A:** It's coming in the next update! We're integrating Google Imagen AI to generate custom, royalty-free images based on your blog title and content. For now, use the upload or URL options.

---

### **Q: Can I share to Facebook, Twitter, etc.?**

**A:** Currently, only LinkedIn has a one-click button. For other platforms, copy the WordPress URL and paste it into your post. We'll add more social platforms in future updates!
