## ⏳ **REMAINING WORK (Part 2B)**

Need to add these UI components to complete the feature:

### 1. **Assignment Dropdown in Table**
Each lead row needs a dropdown like this:
```jsx
<select 
  value={lead.assigned_to || ''}
  onChange={(e) => handleAssignLead(lead.id, e.target.value ? parseInt(e.target.value) : null)}
>
  <option value="">Unassigned</option>
  {teamMembers.map(user => (
    <option key={user.id} value={user.id}>
      {user.username} ({user.role})
    </option>
  ))}
</select>
```

### 2. **"Assigned To" Column in Table**
Add column header and display assigned user name

### 3. **"Assigned To" Filter Dropdown**
In the filters section, add:
```jsx
<select value={assignedToFilter} onChange={(e) => setAssignedToFilter(e.target.value)}>
  <option value="all">All Leads</option>
  <option value="unassigned">Unassigned</option>
  <option value="assigned">Assigned</option>
  {teamMembers.map(user => (
    <option key={user.id} value={user.id.toString()}>
      {user.username}
    </option>
  ))}
</select>
```

## 📋 **HOW IT WORKS NOW**

### For Super Admin (you - info@wetechforu.com):
1. **See ALL leads** (not filtered by default)
2. **Can assign ANY lead** to any WeTechForU team member
3. **Click "Show My Leads"** → See only leads assigned to you
4. **Select multiple leads** → Click "Assign Selected"
5. **Use bulk assignment** for efficiency

### For Team Members (once assigned):
1. **Login** → Automatically see ONLY their assigned leads
2. **Same UI** as super admin
3. **Can manage** their assigned leads fully
4. **Cannot see** other team members' leads
5. **Can view** lead details, send emails, generate SEO reports

---

## 🎯 **WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN NEXT**

### Option A: **Complete the UI (Recommended)**
Finish adding the 3 missing UI components above. This will give you full visual assignment capability.

### Option B: **Use API Directly (Temporary)**
You can assign leads via API calls right now:
```bash
# Assign lead ID 4 to user ID 2
curl -X POST https://www.marketingby.wetechforu.com/api/lead-assignment/assign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"lead_id": 4, "assigned_to": 2, "reason": "manual_assignment"}'
```

## 📊 **CURRENT USER ROLES**

| Email | Role | Can Assign Leads? | Sees ALL Leads? |
|-------|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| info@wetechforu.com | super_admin | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (unless "My Leads" ON) |
| Team Member | admin/user | ❌ No | ❌ No (only assigned) |

---

## 🚀 **READY TO TEST**

The system is **90% complete**! Here's what you can test RIGHT NOW:

1. Go to: https://www.marketingby.wetechforu.com/app/leads
2. See the **"Show My Leads"** button (green) at the top
3. Click it → It will filter to only leads assigned to you
4. Select some leads → See **"Assign Selected"** button appear
5. Backend APIs are fully functional

**Once we add the dropdown and filter UI, you'll have full visual control!**

---

## 💡 **NEXT STEPS**

Let me know if you want to:
1. ✅ **Complete the UI** (add dropdown + filter) - Recommended!
2. 🧪 **Test the current functionality** first
3. 📝 **Customize the bulk assignment prompt** (make it a modal instead of prompt)

**The hardest part (backend + logic) is DONE!** Just need the final UI touches. 🎉
