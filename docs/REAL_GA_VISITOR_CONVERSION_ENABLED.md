## 📝 **What Changed in the Code**

### **File Updated:**
`backend/src/services/realGoogleAnalyticsLeadCaptureService.ts`

### **Key Changes:**
1. **Removed**: Mock data generation (except as fallback)
2. **Added**: Real Google Analytics Data API integration
3. **Added**: OAuth2 client initialization
4. **Added**: Visitor data fetching with city/country dimensions
5. **Added**: Real-time processing of GA4 data
6. **Added**: Fallback to mock data if API fails

### **API Call:**
```javascript
const response = await analytics.properties.runReport({
  property: `properties/${propertyId}`,
  requestBody: {
    dateRanges: [{ startDate: '2025-09-18', endDate: '2025-10-18' }],
    dimensions: ['city', 'country', 'date', 'sessionDefaultChannelGrouping'],
    metrics: ['sessions', 'screenPageViews', 'averageSessionDuration'],
    limit: '1000'
  },
  auth: oauth2Client
});
```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If You See "Using mock data":**
- **Reason**: OAuth credentials not found or expired
- **Solution**: Reconnect Google Analytics in Settings tab
- **Fallback**: System will use mock data temporarily

### **If No Leads Are Created:**
- **Check**: Are there visitors from nearby cities?
- **Check**: Is the radius set correctly (5-20 miles)?
- **Check**: Are all visitors from distant locations?
- **Solution**: Increase radius or check GA data

### **If Duplicates Are Skipped:**
- **This is normal!** Duplicate prevention is working
- **First sync**: Creates new leads
- **Second sync**: Skips existing leads
- **Message**: "Captured 0 new leads, skipped X duplicates"
