# 🔄 RESTART BACKEND SERVER NOW

**Issue:** Dashboard routes were added but backend needs restart to load them.

---

## ✅ Quick Fix (Takes 30 seconds)

### Step 1: Stop Backend Server
In the terminal running backend:
```
Press: Ctrl + C
```

### Step 2: Restart Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Wait for:** 
```
✅ Server running on port 3001
✅ Connected to PostgreSQL database
```

### Step 3: Refresh Browser
- Go back to browser
- **Refresh the page** (F5 or Ctrl+R)
- You should see the dashboard load! 🎉

---

## 🎯 What This Will Fix

After restart, the backend will:
- ✅ Load the new `/api/client-dashboard` routes
- ✅ Fetch real data from database
- ✅ Return dashboard data to frontend

---

## ⚠️ Important

**DO NOT stop the frontend server** - only restart the backend!

Frontend (port 5173) can keep running.

## 📊 After Restart, You'll See:

Instead of the yellow error box, you'll see:
- ✅ Welcome back! Demo-2
- ✅ Metric cards (Leads, SEO, Traffic, Facebook)  
- ✅ Company profile
- ✅ Connected services
- ✅ Recent reports

**🚀 Restart the backend now and refresh your browser!**
