## 💡 Tips

**Creating Good Questions:**
- Keep questions short and clear
- Use required for critical info (name, email)
- Use optional for nice-to-have (phone, services)
- Dropdown for multiple choice (contact method)
- Textarea for longer answers (describe needs)

**Best Practice Order:**
1. First name (builds rapport)
2. Last name
3. Email (for follow-up)
4. Phone (optional)
5. Contact preference
6. Services/needs (optional)

**Don't Overdo It:**
- 6-8 questions max (users drop off after too many)
- More required fields = higher abandonment
- Keep it conversational, not interrogation
