- Look for "Users" or "User Management" in the sidebar
- Click "Add New User" or "Create User"

### 3. Fill in User Details
```
Email: demo2@abc.com
Password: Demo@2025 (or any password you want)
Username: Demo2 Client Admin
First Name: Demo2
Last Name: Admin
Role: client_admin
Assigned Client: Demo-2 (ID: 199) ⚠️ IMPORTANT!
Status: Active ✓
```

### 4. Save & Verify

### 5. Test Login

  Password: Demo@2025
  ```

## 🔍 Current Database Status

From the verification script:

**Clients Found:**
- ✅ ID: 166, Name: Demo, Email: ramaniashish1999@gmail.com
- ✅ ID: 199, Name: Demo-2, Email: abc@demo2.com ← **Use this one!**

**Users:**
- ❌ No demo2 user found (needs to be created)

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Make sure to select "Demo-2" (ID: 199) when creating the user**
2. The client name in database is "Demo-2" not "Demo2"
3. If you don't see the user creation form, look for:
   - "Users" menu item
   - "Manage Users"
   - "User Management"
   - Or check the admin panel sidebar

---

## 🆘 Alternative: Create via Script

If you can't find the user creation form in Super Admin, run this:

```bash
cd backend
node create_demo2_user.js
```

Then verify:
```bash
node check_demo2_user.js
```

---

**Once user is created, the dashboard will work perfectly! 🎉**
