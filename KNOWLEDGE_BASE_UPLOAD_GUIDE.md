# 📚 **Knowledge Base Upload Guide**

## 🐛 **Problem You Encountered**

**Error:** `Missing question or answer`

**Root Cause:** Your JSON used `user_question` and `bot_answer`, but the system expects `question` and `answer`.

---

## ✅ **Fixed JSON File**

**Location:** `wetechforu-knowledge-base-corrected.json`

This file contains all 50 entries with the correct format:

```json
[
  {
    "question": "who is wetechforu",
    "answer": "WeTechForU is a web, cloud, and marketing partner...",
    "category": "brand"
  },
  ...
]
```

---

## 📋 **Required Format**

### **Field Names:**
- ✅ `question` (not `user_question`)
- ✅ `answer` (not `bot_answer`)
- ✅ `category` (optional, defaults to "General")

### **Example Entry:**
```json
{
  "question": "do you build websites",

## 🔍 **Testing Your Bot**

After upload, test with these questions:

### **Brand Questions:**
- "who is wetechforu"
- "where are you located"
- "how to contact you"

### **Service Questions:**
- "do you build websites"
- "can you migrate to azure"
- "do you do local seo"

### **Pricing Questions:**
- "how much does a website cost"
- "do you offer monthly plans"

### **Support Questions:**
- "how to get support"
- "urgent issue"

---

## 🎨 **Alternative Questions (Variations)**

The bot will match similar questions even if users don't type the exact phrase:

**Example:**
- User types: "tell me about wetechforu"
- Bot matches: "who is wetechforu"
- Bot answers: "WeTechForU is a web, cloud, and marketing partner..."

**Smart matching works on:**
- Synonyms
- Different word order
- Partial matches
- Keywords

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **1. Keep Questions Short & Natural**
```

❌ Too long: "I was wondering if your company offers services..."
```

### **2. Use Categories for Organization**
```
✅ Good: Use clear categories (brand, web, seo, cloud)
❌ Bad: Put everything in "general"
```

### **3. Write Conversational Answers**
```
✅ Good: "Yes we build fast secure WordPress sites..."
❌ Bad: "WeTechForU offers the following website building services..."
```

### **4. Test After Upload**
